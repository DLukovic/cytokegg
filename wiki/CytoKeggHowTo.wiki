== The Index ==
CytoKegg Relies on an Index in order to store pathway data as well as expression datasets. The Index is created when the application is used for the first time when six model organisms will be indexed by default, however more can be indexed later on.

Organisms indexed by default:

* Homo sapiens (human)
* Mus musculus (mouse)
* Rattus norvegicus (rat)
* Danio rerio (zebrafish)
* Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)

In order to access the index, go to Apps > CytoKegg > Repository. Once there, it is possible to rebuild the index and add another organism.

== Browse Pathways ==
CytoKegg can import pathways into Cytoscape by going to Apps > CytoKegg > Browse Pathways
